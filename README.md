Caveats:

interesting, adding a comma between art style like "Impressionism style , animal mustang" produces images where the art style was confined to the inside parts of the animal.

this can be seen here, 

![cow](./animals%20cubism/00410-899013019.png?raw=true)
![cow](./animals%20cubism%202/00416-3518403274.png?raw=true)

but removing the comma "Impressionism style animal mustang",

the art style coveres the image and the background,

sometimes it didn't apply at all:

![ermine](./animals%20cubism/00378-3463598972.png?raw=true)
![ermine](./animals%20cubism%202/00384-471156219.png?raw=true)


Brainstorming more combo prompts:

lots of sheep doing interesting things, something like sheep tarot
famous and iconic buildings
famous and iconic places
playing cards royalty - michael
colorful burning carcassas - image in my head to scare hipster aliens away
animals covered in diamonds, make really cool geometric backgrounds and combine with an art style from previous generation
