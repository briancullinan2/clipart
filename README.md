Caveats:

interesting, adding a comma between art style like "Impressionism style , animal mustang" produces images where the art style was confined to the inside parts of the animal.

this can be seen here,

![cow](./animals%20cubism%202/00416-3518403274.png?raw=true)

but removing the comma "Impressionism style animal mustang",

the art style coveres the image and the background,

sometimes it didn't apply at all:

Combining multiple art styles, i.e. retro 80s style <buildings>, cyberpunk style <animals>. I ended up with at least 5 out of 50 images that didn't include the animal in the first pass missing the word style. Only half the animals were coming out cyberpunk style, not like the  `animals cyberpunk` folder. It doesn't appear to matter if I make a prompt with parenthesis like `retro 80s buildings , ( cyberpunk animals )`. The images came out inheriting the 80s style on the animals, so I made the animals the subject like `(Cyberpunk style animal kitten:2.0), (Retro 80s style Hagia Sophia Istanbul Turkey:0.9)` or `(Cyberpunk style:2.0) ( animal kitten:1.1) , (Retro 80s style:2.0) (Hagia Sophia Istanbul Turkey:0.9)`. With the expectations that the cyberpunk looking animals would inherit cyberpunk looking buildings with retro 80s style tones, and the non-cyberpunk animals would still look retro 80s style with cartoonish buildings. It appears the weighting of the effects of each part of the picture can be tuned, but I am not sure what the :## designation means in terms of Juggernaut.



missing the word style, added the word style, added parenthesis qualifier, added object weights?

For buildings I added a painting qualifier to see if the style would vary more dramatically, I also only selected 12 more interesting art styles. It seems to use the context of art style, or context of imagary for art style. It's about 50/50 if the image shows up correctly for styles like Baroque and Rococo or if the image is just plainly painted looking with no additional style.

Brainstorming more combo prompts:

* lots of sheep doing interesting things, something like sheep tarot
* famous and iconic buildings
* famous and iconic places
* playing cards royalty - michael
* colorful burning carcassas - image in my head to scare hipster aliens away
* animals covered in diamonds, make really cool geometric backgrounds and combine with an art style from previous generation
* feet in different positions with different colors - colleen
* artwork of things, places, animals in a very specific color scheme like for a hotel chain
*
